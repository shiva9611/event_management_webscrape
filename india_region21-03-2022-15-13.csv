https://www.eventbrite.com/e/virtual-speaking-masterclass-bangalore-tickets-134801832911?aff=ebdssbdestsearch,Virtual Speaking Masterclass Bangalore,"You have a glorious opportunity to get your message into the world.Never before has there been such an exciting time in communication.The ability to transmit your words across the world has existed for decades.What has changed a result of COVID-19 is  now people are LISTENING.Virtual communication has now been accepted as the norm. People know that they need to tune into the Facebook Lives and join the Zoom meetings otherwise they are going to be left out of the loop.They are ready to hear your message.Are you ready to give it to them?Your phone and your computer are all you need to make a difference in the world.You have a voice, it’s time to use it.You have a story, it’s time to tell it.You have a message, it’s time to share it.Imagine being able to reach people in places you’ve never heard of and changing the lives of people you have never met.That possibility is more real than ever thanks to virtual speaking.You still aren’t 100% sure about all this, are you?You’ve done some Facebook Lives, you’ve been in some Zoom meetings and you’ve filmed a few selfie videos.You’re trying things out, but you’re not as confident as you’d like to be.It still feels weird not being able to see people.You still feel self conscious seeing yourself on camera.You aren’t getting the likes and comments that you see other people getting on their lives and videos.Does it feel like you’ve been left behind by all this change?You haven’t been left behind yet…but you will if you don’t act now.When the technology arrived to do virtual speaking, only a tiny fraction of people adopted it.During the 2010s they rose to the top of their fields.The “second wave” is now here, and you’ve got to catch it if you want to have a meaningful impact during the 2020s.I joined the second wave late.  I started my Youtube channel in 2015, 10 years after Youtube  had been created.I first used Zoom in 2018, 5 years after Zoom had been created.I was quicker on the uptake with Facebook Live, being one of the first people in my industry to use it in 2016.I didn’t have the audience nor the engagement of my peers, but I kept learning the craft.When lockdown hit in 2020, I was able to seamlessly transition my business online.  I’d been preparing for half a decade to speak virtually whilst the competition got caught with their pants down.  I’ve managed to grow my audience and increase my income in 2020 when so many businesses have struggled or even sadly closed up shop.There’s one thing that made the difference for me and it will make the difference for you too.I knew how to communicate online.I was far more confident with the tech, more practiced in the communication and more open to the switch to virtual.We still have people who don’t know how to unmute themselves on Zoom.  We still have people who speak like an emotionless robot on their Youtube videos.  We still have people who are hoping things will “go back to normal” and they can resume physical business again.  Don’t be one of those people. The second wave of virtual communication is here...are you going to jump on it?This is going to be far bigger than the first wave.If you don’t jump on now, you will get swept away.Equally, if you put in the work now to master virtual speaking, you are going to flourish for the next decade.That is what this Virtual Speaking Masterclass is going to help you do.There are three basic building blocks you need to be a great virtual speaker.Firstly you will learn how to make friends with the camera. Making friends with the camera means that you will:Appear (and feel!) more confident when you present. Speak in a natural, conversational way so that you feel more relaxed.Express your natural creativity and personality quirks so that you feel genuine and authentic.Secondly you will learn why it’s so important to create an “active window”. An active window means that you: Build trust and rapport fastHold people’s attention when they have a million online distractions  Can communicate abstract ideasThirdly you will learn how to effectively interact with your audience. Strong interaction means that your audience will:  View you as their #1 expertImplement more of your ideasBuy more of your stuffAre you ready for the second wave? Then grab your surfboard and sign up for the masterclass! In the true spirit of Virtual Speaking, we will of course be hosting this class virtually so that you can join us from the comfort of your own home.FAQsIs this definitely an online event? Because the event has a physical location?Yes this is entirely online. The physical location allows people in your city (such as you!) to find the event as it shows up as being geographically close to them.Where can I access the masterclass?You can attend the masterclass live on Zoom. You will be sent the link within 24hr of the masterclass beginning. In the event that David is not available on the 25th, you will be sent a link to a recording of a previous session.The event repeats each month, do I need to attend on a monthly basis?

You’ve almost finished your draft and you start shopping around for publishing quotes.One editor quotes $1,200 and another quotes $5,000. One designer will charge $500, while another charges $2,000. And then you approach an end-to-end publishing company who will charge $12,000 for the lot – editing, design, eBook, printing and distribution.Regardless of where your suppliers sit, self-publishing a high-quality  book isn’t cheap, with quotes ranging anywhere from $3,000 to $15,000+.  And then comes... ""I can’t afford to publish my book right now.” Infact, More and more self-published authors are realizing that to publish a professional book, they need to hire a professional publishing team—editors, designers, printers, distributors, and more. The problem: Where are they supposed to find $5k to $15k+ to publish their book? What if they don’t have the extra cash on hand to publish your work? Do you sit on that manuscript and wait years until you can cash in your 401(k)? We hear this a lot. And we get it–publishing can be a large investment for many people, and sometimes publishing seems like it can wait.

Observe a free trial to see if it's right for you. Based out of New York City for 30 years, we are now offering these classes online to an international audience. This one free trial class is an observation session to see if the US$425/10 session program is right for you. The instructor will be happy to answer any questions following the session.Once the 10 session package is purchased, the student may use their sessions however they choose.  The course is ongoing, so each session has participants at all levels. We use a workbook which each student works through at their own pace.This is the 30th year we’ve been helping people turn their dread into confidence. Gradual exposure allows you to face fear in manageable steps, at your own pace, in a supportive environment. Instructors Charles di Cagno and Kyra Smith, are phobia therapists, and former and current Directors of Public Speaking at White Plains Hospital Anxiety Treatment Center in the United States. Whatever the level of public speaking, we can help you improve. For those with anxiety, we provide gradual exposure to public speaking through a step ladder of basic to more advanced exercises. For the more experienced, it's a platform tailored to your specific needs to improve various delivery techniques. It is self-paced, in a low pressure, supportive environment with lots of feedback to address your specific issues. Begin with basic exercises and move forward only when ready. The course is ongoing, with a mix of beginning and advanced students. Our hope is you are inspired, not intimidated by the dynamic speakers present, and keep in mind they started with the same fears, progressing to their present level by consistent effort. The course is not difficult. If you have the will, we offer the way to turn a liability into your most powerful asset. The real challenge is admitting you need guidance, getting started, and making a committed, consistent effort.Our 100% success rate over 20 years for wedding speeches is just one indication of our effectiveness.

You will stand, with several others and respond to simple questions. As your confidence increases, one by one, each person standing will sit, until you are standing alone. You will continue until this begins to feel comfortable.Session Three- This exercise is the same as the previous one except you start by standing alone.Session Four - Gestures and Movement. Enhance your message, decrease tension and project a confident demeanor incorporating non-verbal skills.Session Five - Implement the skills learned in the session four by relating a personal experience using gestures and movement to enhance your narrative.Session Six - Respond to Questions. Open the floor to questions on a topic of choice.Session Seven - Impromptu Speaking. Learn to organize and deliver an unprepared (no notes) talk.Session Eight - Prepared Speech (Instructor Guided).

You’ve almost finished your draft and you start shopping around for publishing quotes.One editor quotes $1,200 and another quotes $5,000. One designer will charge $500, while another charges $2,000. And then you approach an end-to-end publishing company who will charge $12,000 for the lot – editing, design, eBook, printing and distribution.Regardless of where your suppliers sit, self-publishing a high-quality  book isn’t cheap, with quotes ranging anywhere from $3,000 to $15,000+.  And then comes... ""I can’t afford to publish my book right now.” Infact, More and more self-published authors are realizing that to publish a professional book, they need to hire a professional publishing team—editors, designers, printers, distributors, and more. The problem: Where are they supposed to find $5k to $15k+ to publish their book? What if they don’t have the extra cash on hand to publish your work? Do you sit on that manuscript and wait years until you can cash in your 401(k)? We hear this a lot. And we get it–publishing can be a large investment for many people, and sometimes publishing seems like it can wait. But when we hear authors shying away from a publishing project because of funding, we simply smile and say, “Not so fast!” There are  proven ways to monetize the pre-launch period of your publishing project, so if you’re looking to publish but don’t have the means, then this masterclass is for YOU!Whether you need money for editing, the design of the book, printing, the marketing, or all of it, you can find the capital you need. It is a 2 hour workshop, where Ash teaches you the hidden secrets on how you too can build a business around your book and monetize the pre-launch period, going into immense detail on why, what, and how to do specific little-known critical things in the book pre-launch/publishing process.

Observe a free trial to see if it's right for you. Based out of New York City for 30 years, we are now offering these classes online to an international audience. This one free trial class is an observation session to see if the US$425/10 session program is right for you. The instructor will be happy to answer any questions following the session.Once the 10 session package is purchased, the student may use their sessions however they choose.  The course is ongoing, so each session has participants at all levels. We use a workbook which each student works through at their own pace.This is the 30th year we’ve been helping people turn their dread into confidence. Gradual exposure allows you to face fear in manageable steps, at your own pace, in a supportive environment. Instructors Charles di Cagno and Kyra Smith, are phobia therapists, and former and current Directors of Public Speaking at White Plains Hospital Anxiety Treatment Center in the United States. Whatever the level of public speaking, we can help you improve. For those with anxiety, we provide gradual exposure to public speaking through a step ladder of basic to more advanced exercises. For the more experienced, it's a platform tailored to your specific needs to improve various delivery techniques. It is self-paced, in a low pressure, supportive environment with lots of feedback to address your specific issues. Begin with basic exercises and move forward only when ready. The course is ongoing, with a mix of beginning and advanced students. Our hope is you are inspired, not intimidated by the dynamic speakers present, and keep in mind they started with the same fears, progressing to their present level by consistent effort. The course is not difficult. If you have the will, we offer the way to turn a liability into your most powerful asset. The real challenge is admitting you need guidance, getting started, and making a committed, consistent effort.Our 100% success rate over 20 years for wedding speeches is just one indication of our effectiveness. But, whatever the challenge, (formal presentation, group discussion, business meeting, sales, confrontation, employment interview) the program is customized to fit your needs.Sample Gradual Exposure Program Outline for Public Speaking Anxiety:Session One - Get comfortable hearing your voice in public by responding to very simple questions while seated. The questions (i.e., name, occupation, where you live, etc.) require little thought or content.Session Two - Learning to stand confidently before a group. You will stand, with several others and respond to simple questions. As your confidence increases, one by one, each person standing will sit, until you are standing alone. You will continue until this begins to feel comfortable.Session Three- This exercise is the same as the previous one except you start by standing alone.Session Four - Gestures and Movement. Enhance your message, decrease tension and project a confident demeanor incorporating non-verbal skills.Session Five - Implement the skills learned in the session four by relating a personal experience using gestures and movement to enhance your narrative.Session Six - Respond to Questions. Open the floor to questions on a topic of choice.Session Seven - Impromptu Speaking. Learn to organize and deliver an unprepared (no notes) talk.Session Eight - Prepared Speech (Instructor Guided). Learn the secret of outlining and presenting a prepared speech with minimal effort or stress.Session Nine - Prepared Speech. Outline and deliver a speech unassisted.Once you have mastered the above you can begin simulating all manner of interpersonal and public communication including:Persuasive SpeakingPanel DiscussionConflict ResolutionDefending your PositionDebatingInitiating and Sustaining ConversationAs well as many othersWe look forward to working with you.", k smith,"MumbaiMumbai, Mumbai, MH 400051",72.8552983|19.05961,2021-07-31T19:30:00+05:30,2022-08-13T21:00:00+05:30,"['India Events', 'Maharashtra Events', 'Things to do in Mumbai', 'Mumbai Classes', 'Mumbai Business Classes', '#publicspeaking', '#publicspeakingworkshop', '#self_improvement', '#public_speaking', '#business_networking', '#self_development', '#business_professional', '#course_workshop_events', '#public_speaking_online', '#public_speaking_practice']",Not Available,Business Classes,Not Available,https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F142746263%2F446023017920%2F1%2Foriginal.20210702-191738?w=480&auto=format%2Ccompress&q=75&sharp=10&rect=0%2C5%2C1426%2C713&s=37257f894a966d3d1b03980b08dd9170

https://www.eventbrite.com/e/virtual-speaking-masterclass-mumbai-tickets-134801670425?aff=ebdssbdestsearch,Virtual Speaking Masterclass Mumbai,"You have a glorious opportunity to get your message into the world.Never before has there been such an exciting time in communication.The ability to transmit your words across the world has existed for decades.What has changed a result of COVID-19 is  now people are LISTENING.Virtual communication has now been accepted as the norm. People know that they need to tune into the Facebook Lives and join the Zoom meetings otherwise they are going to be left out of the loop.They are ready to hear your message.Are you ready to give it to them?Your phone and your computer are all you need to make a difference in the world.You have a voice, it’s time to use it.You have a story, it’s time to tell it.You have a message, it’s time to share it.Imagine being able to reach people in places you’ve never heard of and changing the lives of people you have never met.That possibility is more real than ever thanks to virtual speaking.You still aren’t 100% sure about all this, are you?You’ve done some Facebook Lives, you’ve been in some Zoom meetings and you’ve filmed a few selfie videos.You’re trying things out, but you’re not as confident as you’d like to be.It still feels weird not being able to see people.You still feel self conscious seeing yourself on camera.You aren’t getting the likes and comments that you see other people getting on their lives and videos.Does it feel like you’ve been left behind by all this change?You haven’t been left behind yet…but you will if you don’t act now.When the technology arrived to do virtual speaking, only a tiny fraction of people adopted it.During the 2010s they rose to the top of their fields.The “second wave” is now here, and you’ve got to catch it if you want to have a meaningful impact during the 2020s.I joined the second wave late.  I started my Youtube channel in 2015, 10 years after Youtube  had been created.I first used Zoom in 2018, 5 years after Zoom had been created.I was quicker on the uptake with Facebook Live, being one of the first people in my industry to use it in 2016.I didn’t have the audience nor the engagement of my peers, but I kept learning the craft.When lockdown hit in 2020, I was able to seamlessly transition my business online.  I’d been preparing for half a decade to speak virtually whilst the competition got caught with their pants down.  I’ve managed to grow my audience and increase my income in 2020 when so many businesses have struggled or even sadly closed up shop.There’s one thing that made the difference for me and it will make the difference for you too.I knew how to communicate online.I was far more confident with the tech, more practiced in the communication and more open to the switch to virtual.We still have people who don’t know how to unmute themselves on Zoom.  We still have people who speak like an emotionless robot on their Youtube videos.  We still have people who are hoping things will “go back to normal” and they can resume physical business again.  Don’t be one of those people. The second wave of virtual communication is here...are you going to jump on it?This is going to be far bigger than the first wave.If you don’t jump on now, you will get swept away.Equally, if you put in the work now to master virtual speaking, you are going to flourish for the next decade.That is what this Virtual Speaking Masterclass is going to help you do.There are three basic building blocks you need to be a great virtual speaker.Firstly you will learn how to make friends with the camera. Making friends with the camera means that you will:Appear (and feel!) more confident when you present. Speak in a natural, conversational way so that you feel more relaxed.Express your natural creativity and personality quirks so that you feel genuine and authentic.Secondly you will learn why it’s so important to create an “active window”. An active window means that you: Build trust and rapport fastHold people’s attention when they have a million online distractions  Can communicate abstract ideasThirdly you will learn how to effectively interact with your audience. Strong interaction means that your audience will:  View you as their #1 expertImplement more of your ideasBuy more of your stuffAre you ready for the second wave? Then grab your surfboard and sign up for the masterclass! In the true spirit of Virtual Speaking, we will of course be hosting this class virtually so that you can join us from the comfort of your own home.FAQsIs this definitely an online event? Because the event has a physical location?Yes this is entirely online. The physical location allows people in your city (such as you!) to find the event as it shows up as being geographically close to them.Where can I access the masterclass?You can attend the masterclass live on Zoom. You will be sent the link within 24hr of the masterclass beginning. In the event that David is not available on the 25th, you will be sent a link to a recording of a previous session.The event repeats each month, do I need to attend on a monthly basis?

You’ve almost finished your draft and you start shopping around for publishing quotes.One editor quotes $1,200 and another quotes $5,000. One designer will charge $500, while another charges $2,000. And then you approach an end-to-end publishing company who will charge $12,000 for the lot – editing, design, eBook, printing and distribution.Regardless of where your suppliers sit, self-publishing a high-quality  book isn’t cheap, with quotes ranging anywhere from $3,000 to $15,000+.  And then comes... ""I can’t afford to publish my book right now.” Infact, More and more self-published authors are realizing that to publish a professional book, they need to hire a professional publishing team—editors, designers, printers, distributors, and more. The problem: Where are they supposed to find $5k to $15k+ to publish their book? What if they don’t have the extra cash on hand to publish your work? Do you sit on that manuscript and wait years until you can cash in your 401(k)? We hear this a lot. And we get it–publishing can be a large investment for many people, and sometimes publishing seems like it can wait. But when we hear authors shying away from a publishing project because of funding, we simply smile and say, “Not so fast!” There are  proven ways to monetize the pre-launch period of your publishing project, so if you’re looking to publish but don’t have the means, then this masterclass is for YOU!Whether you need money for editing, the design of the book, printing, the marketing, or all of it, you can find the capital you need. It is a 2 hour workshop, where Ash teaches you the hidden secrets on how you too can build a business around your book and monetize the pre-launch period, going into immense detail on why, what, and how to do specific little-known critical things in the book pre-launch/publishing process.

You’ve almost finished your draft and you start shopping around for publishing quotes.One editor quotes $1,200 and another quotes $5,000. One designer will charge $500, while another charges $2,000. And then you approach an end-to-end publishing company who will charge $12,000 for the lot – editing, design, eBook, printing and distribution.Regardless of where your suppliers sit, self-publishing a high-quality  book isn’t cheap, with quotes ranging anywhere from $3,000 to $15,000+.  And then comes... ""I can’t afford to publish my book right now.” Infact, More and more self-published authors are realizing that to publish a professional book, they need to hire a professional publishing team—editors, designers, printers, distributors, and more. The problem: Where are they supposed to find $5k to $15k+ to publish their book? What if they don’t have the extra cash on hand to publish your work? Do you sit on that manuscript and wait years until you can cash in your 401(k)? We hear this a lot. And we get it–publishing can be a large investment for many people, and sometimes publishing seems like it can wait. But when we hear authors shying away from a publishing project because of funding, we simply smile and say, “Not so fast!” There are  proven ways to monetize the pre-launch period of your publishing project, so if you’re looking to publish but don’t have the means, then this masterclass is for YOU!Whether you need money for editing, the design of the book, printing, the marketing, or all of it, you can find the capital you need. It is a 2 hour workshop, where Ash teaches you the hidden secrets on how you too can build a business around your book and monetize the pre-launch period, going into immense detail on why, what, and how to do specific little-known critical things in the book pre-launch/publishing process.  In case you miss the live session, you will still be able to watch the recordings of the live session. Frequently asked questions…Is it in-person Masterclass or virtual Masterclass? This is a virtual Masterclass and you can attend it from the comfort of your homeIs this workshop helpful to non-fiction writers or children books ? Definitely! The processes and strategies taught are geared towards everyone, including non-fiction writers, fiction writers and children book writers. What If I only have an Idea and haven't started writing yet? It doesn't matter which stage you are at, you will be able to get funding for your book even if you have an idea/or just a thought of it.Here is what attendees said about the past events:""Thank you for sharing valuable knowledge.

People know that they need to tune into the Facebook Lives and join the Zoom meetings otherwise they are going to be left out of the loop.They are ready to hear your message.Are you ready to give it to them?Your phone and your computer are all you need to make a difference in the world.You have a voice, it’s time to use it.You have a story, it’s time to tell it.You have a message, it’s time to share it.Imagine being able to reach people in places you’ve never heard of and changing the lives of people you have never met.That possibility is more real than ever thanks to virtual speaking.You still aren’t 100% sure about all this, are you?You’ve done some Facebook Lives, you’ve been in some Zoom meetings and you’ve filmed a few selfie videos.You’re trying things out, but you’re not as confident as you’d like to be.It still feels weird not being able to see people.You still feel self conscious seeing yourself on camera.You aren’t getting the likes and comments that you see other people getting on their lives and videos.Does it feel like you’ve been left behind by all this change?You haven’t been left behind yet…but you will if you don’t act now.When the technology arrived to do virtual speaking, only a tiny fraction of people adopted it.During the 2010s they rose to the top of their fields.The “second wave” is now here, and you’ve got to catch it if you want to have a meaningful impact during the 2020s.I joined the second wave late.  I started my Youtube channel in 2015, 10 years after Youtube  had been created.I first used Zoom in 2018, 5 years after Zoom had been created.I was quicker on the uptake with Facebook Live, being one of the first people in my industry to use it in 2016.I didn’t have the audience nor the engagement of my peers, but I kept learning the craft.When lockdown hit in 2020, I was able to seamlessly transition my business online.  I’d been preparing for half a decade to speak virtually whilst the competition got caught with their pants down.  I’ve managed to grow my audience and increase my income in 2020 when so many businesses have struggled or even sadly closed up shop.There’s one thing that made the difference for me and it will make the difference for you too.I knew how to communicate online.I was far more confident with the tech, more practiced in the communication and more open to the switch to virtual.We still have people who don’t know how to unmute themselves on Zoom.  We still have people who speak like an emotionless robot on their Youtube videos.  We still have people who are hoping things will “go back to normal” and they can resume physical business again.  Don’t be one of those people. The second wave of virtual communication is here...are you going to jump on it?This is going to be far bigger than the first wave.If you don’t jump on now, you will get swept away.Equally, if you put in the work now to master virtual speaking, you are going to flourish for the next decade.That is what this Virtual Speaking Masterclass is going to help you do.There are three basic building blocks you need to be a great virtual speaker.Firstly you will learn how to make friends with the camera. Making friends with the camera means that you will:Appear (and feel!) more confident when you present. Speak in a natural, conversational way so that you feel more relaxed.Express your natural creativity and personality quirks so that you feel genuine and authentic.Secondly you will learn why it’s so important to create an “active window”. An active window means that you: Build trust and rapport fastHold people’s attention when they have a million online distractions  Can communicate abstract ideasThirdly you will learn how to effectively interact with your audience. Strong interaction means that your audience will:  View you as their #1 expertImplement more of your ideasBuy more of your stuffAre you ready for the second wave? Then grab your surfboard and sign up for the masterclass! In the true spirit of Virtual Speaking, we will of course be hosting this class virtually so that you can join us from the comfort of your own home.FAQsIs this definitely an online event? Because the event has a physical location?Yes this is entirely online. The physical location allows people in your city (such as you!) to find the event as it shows up as being geographically close to them.Where can I access the masterclass?You can attend the masterclass live on Zoom. You will be sent the link within 24hr of the masterclass beginning. In the event that David is not available on the 25th, you will be sent a link to a recording of a previous session.The event repeats each month, do I need to attend on a monthly basis?
